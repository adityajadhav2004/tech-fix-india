## 🚀 My Journey in Building Tech Fix India

As a college student, I embarked on this project to apply my web development skills to a real-world problem. I learned about full-stack development, database management, and backend APIs.

### 🔥 Challenges Faced
- **Setting up MySQL database**: Debugging connectivity errors taught me how MySQL and Node.js interact.
- **Complaint Tracking System**: Creating a dynamic tracking system was a learning curve.
- **Building a chatbot**: Initially a simple JavaScript chatbot, but AI-powered solutions seem promising.
- **UI/UX Design Choices**: Research was needed to align the design with Indian users’ preferences.

### 🚧 Potential Issues & Future Improvements
- **Scalability**: Moving to a cloud-based MySQL service for better performance.
- **Security Concerns**: Implementing proper authentication for admins.
- **Advanced AI Chatbot**: Upgrading with NLP capabilities.
- **Automated Notifications**: Real-time email and WhatsApp notifications for complaint updates.

### 🎯 Expected Outcome
✔ **Complaint & Tracking System (stored in MySQL)**
✔ **Feedback System**
✔ **Simple Chatbot for FAQs**
✔ **Admin Panel for Complaint Management**
✔ **Fully Responsive & Mobile-Optimized UI**
